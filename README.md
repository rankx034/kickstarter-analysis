# Performing analysis on Kickstarter trends
In this analysis, we examined trends in Kickstarter fundraising data, paying particular attention to the traits we observed in successful vs. failed campaigns in the "theater" category.

First, we analyzed outcomes across all categories to get a broad understanding of the overall success rate for campaigns hosted on Kickstarter. In doing so, we found that the "theater" category had a much more even ratio of success to failure than other popular entertainment categories, such as "film & video" and "music". The "theater" category also has significantly more total campaigns than the next most popular category, "music". This suggests that the higher proportion of failed campaigns in the "theater" category could be related to market saturation. See Figure I below.

Next, we compared the average goal and pledges for both failed and successful campaigns in order to see whether therein lies any helpful information for running future Kickstarter campaigns. What we found was that successful campaigns had much more modest goals compared to failed campaigns, so it is important not to think too big when launching a Kickstarter.
